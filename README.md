Face Mask Detection using Transfer Learning with  (MobileNet-V1)  model 
This project leverages transfer learning with the (MobileNet-V1) model to create an efficient face mask detection system. By utilizing pre-trained weights and data augmentation, the model accurately classifies images as either masked or unmasked, contributing to public health and safety by ensuring mask-wearing compliance
About
Face mask detection is crucial in various scenarios, such as public spaces, workplaces, and healthcare facilities. This project aims to automate the process of identifying individuals who are not wearing masks. 
 
Dataset
This model is trained on the ImageNet dataset and use a modified version of kaggle mask dataset to preform transfer learning.
